# Potato Leaf Disease Classification Using CNN, VGG16, and EfficientNetB0

##  Overview
This project focuses on detecting potato plant diseases from leaf images using deep learning models. Three models were developed and compared:
- **Custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** (built from scratch)
- **Transfer Learning with VGG16** (pre-trained on ImageNet)
- **Transfer Learning with EfficientNetB0** (pre-trained model)

The objective was to build high-accuracy classification models and understand the impact of using pre-trained architectures versus a custom-built CNN.

##  Project Workflow
- **Dataset Loading**: Images of healthy and diseased potato leaves were loaded from a structured directory.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Visualized class distribution
  - Analyzed pixel intensity distributions
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Resizing images to **256x256**
  - Normalizing pixel values to **[0, 1]** range
  - Data augmentation (random flips and rotations)
- **Model Building**:
  - Custom CNN: Multiple convolutional and pooling layers
  - VGG16: Transfer learning with added custom dense layers
  - EfficientNetB0: Transfer learning with added dense layers
- **Model Training and Evaluation**:
  - Trained over **10 epochs**
  - Evaluated using accuracy, loss curves, confusion matrices, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Dataset Structure
The dataset contains three classes:
- **Potato___Early_blight**
- **Potato___Late_blight**
- **Potato___healthy**

Example structure:
```bash
/dataset_path/
    /Potato___Early_blight/
    /Potato___Late_blight/
    /Potato___healthy/
```

## Model Results

| Model                          | Validation Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|---------------------------------|----------------------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Custom CNN                     | ~95%                 | High      | High   | High     |
| VGG16 (Transfer Learning)       | ~98%                 | 0.98      | 0.98   | 0.98     |
| EfficientNetB0 (Transfer Learning) | ~99%             | 0.99      | 0.99   | 0.99     |

âœ… **EfficientNetB0** slightly outperformed other models with the highest accuracy and F1-score.
